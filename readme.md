## Introduction

The Reilman Two-Finger Parallel Gripper is designed to provide users with easy-to-use and high-quality operational capabilities. The gripper is developed with the self-developed WHJ03 integrated joint as the core component, featuring high dynamic response, high load capacity, compact size, strong versatility, easy installation, and simple maintenance. According to task requirements, the gripper can be flexibly and conveniently deployed on complex robots, at the end of mechanical arms, or on PLC production lines, to address grasping, sorting, and handling needs in industrial, commercial, domestic, and educational scenarios. The robot uses a standard RS485 communication interface, supporting serial port protocol and Modbus RTU protocol. The simple and efficient interface and control commands allow users to quickly achieve control of the gripper.
<br>
Reilman also provides a host computer software for the gripper, which can meet the operational needs for targets of different textures and shapes by setting various parameters such as gripping force, speed, position, etc.

#### BOM

For the BOM information of the control board, please refer to the **Claw Interface Board BOM** file under the `Hardware > BOM` path in the obtained open-source files.

### Communication Interface

The two-finger parallel gripper uses a 6-pin aviation plug and a 6-pin PH2.0 terminal for communication interfaces.

#### Wiring Definition

**6-pin Aviation Plug:**

- Custom aviation plug, compact size, can be directly connected to RM mechanical arms, easy to use;
- Since the core number and wire sequence of other mechanical arm manufacturers are different, it is necessary to rearrange according to the wire sequence function;
- Supports two IO interfaces, as the two-finger parallel gripper is mainly used for mechanical arms, only the RS485 and Modus-RTU interfaces need to be retained to meet the needs of most scenarios.

**6-pin PH2.0 Terminal:**

- Fixedly installed at the bottom of the gripper mounting seat with a female header.
- Connected to the 6-pin terminal male header output by the mechanical arm end cover to achieve internal wiring, avoiding interference caused by external wiring during the grasping process of the two-finger parallel gripper.

### Host Computer Software

The main control unit can configure parameters, control modes, protocol I/O, monitor status, and upgrade firmware for the two-finger parallel claw through the master control interface.

#### Wiring

The main control unit can be directly connected to the two-finger parallel gripper via RS485 to USB, and then the host computer software can be used to control the gripper.
<br>
**The specific wiring method is as follows**:

1. Connect the two blue and green wires of the gripper to 24V and GND respectively;
2. Connect the two yellow and white wires of the gripper to RS485_A and RS485_B respectively, the 485 module should be common grounded with the gripper power supply;
<br>

Since the host computer is deployed on the PC side, with most interfaces being USB, users need to be equipped with a USB to 485 module, connect the two yellow and white wires of the gripper to the USB to 485 module, and then achieve the goal of the PC side host computer controlling the gripper through the USB, for the wire sequence description, please refer to [Wire Sequence and Function](#wire-sequence-and-function). As shown in the following figure:

#### Host Computer Debugging

1. **Connection/Disconnection**:
    The gripper is connected to the main control unit via RS485 to USB. Open the host computer software on the main control unit, the first connection enters the device's factory default ID, serial port, baud rate 115200, click `Open` will display a successful connection; click `Close` will disconnect the connection.
2. **Parameter Settings**:
    You can set baud rates, device IDs, and other parameters. After the parameter settings are completed, click `Read Gripper Parameters` in the status monitoring area to display all device parameters.
3. **Mode Control**:
    In mode control, you can set the gripper's limit position, torque, speed, position, etc., specifically as follows:
    - **Maximum/Minimum Limit Position**: The host computer sets the maximum and minimum limit positions of the gripper; the parameter range is 0-1000, dimensionless, 0 corresponds to an opening size of 0mm, 1000 corresponds to the opening size of 65mm for the standard gripper fingers;
    - **Torque**: The host computer sets the gripper to grip with the input speed and torque threshold value, when the gripping force exceeds the set torque threshold, the gripper stops moving; the parameter range is 0-1000, dimensionless, 1000 corresponds to the rated load of 4kg;
    - **Speed**: Sets the opening and closing speed value of the gripper, controlling the opening and closing speed of the gripper during operation. The parameter range is 0-1000, dimensionless, where 1000 corresponds to an opening and closing time of 0.4s;
    - **Opening Size**: Sets the opening size of the gripper, after the gripper receives this instruction, if the current opening size is different from the set opening size, the gripper will move to the opening size at the set speed, and stop moving after reaching the target opening size; the parameter range is 0-1000, dimensionless, where 1000 corresponds to an opening position of 65mm for the standard gripper fingers. The position parameter should be less than the maximum limit position.
    - **Open**: The gripper releases to the maximum opening position at the set fixed speed (maximum speed).
    - **Close**: The gripper closes to the minimum opening position at the set fixed speed (maximum speed).
    - **Torque Gripping**: The gripper grips with the set speed and torque, when the gripping force exceeds the set torque value, the gripper stops moving; when the gripper stops moving, if the gripping force is detected to be less than the torque value, the gripper will continue to grip until the gripping force exceeds the set torque value.
    - Pass-through Energy: Developed for Reilman's high dynamic response function of remote operation, after turning on the `Pass-through Energy` function, the active gripper of the remote operation will respond at a high speed to the control of the passive gripper, facilitating users to carry out low-latency remote operations and data collection.
4. **Protocol/IO Control**:
    - **IO Interface Configuration**: Used to configure the input and output parameters of the two IO interfaces. The specific operation is as follows:
        - **Set**: 1) Select interface DIO/1 or DIO/2; 2) Select `Input Mode` or `Output Mode`, click `Mode Set`; 3) For the input mode, there is no need to set; for the output mode, you can set `Output High Level`, `Output Low Level`; 4) Click `Output Set` to complete the output parameter configuration of this interface.
        - **Query**: After completing the settings for the two interfaces, click `Read Status` to query the status of the two IO interfaces.
        - **Control**: IO control can choose to turn on or off, the default is input mode.
    - **Joint Control**: After the gripper has been working for a while, joint control is used to manually achieve zero position setting. The specific operation is as follows:
        - **Close Gripper**: Click the `Close` button of the gripper, and the gripper closes to the minimum position;
        - **Manual Adjustment**: According to the actual situation, enter the angle that the joint needs to move in the `Movement Angle` box, click `Move` to manually control the gripper movement, then observe the real-time current curve changes in the status monitoring area, when the gripper is fully closed, and the real-time current curve shows no-load current;
        - **Zero Position Setting**: Click `Zero Position Set`, the zero position calibration function is completed, after the calibration is completed, the device needs to be restarted.
    - MB RTU Instruction Control: Used for debugging and testing the protocol instruction functions that come with the factory.
5. **Status Monitoring Area**:
    The status monitoring area can display the set device ID, baud rate, maximum/minimum limit position, gripping speed, gripping force and other parameters through `Read Gripper Parameters`, display the version number of the software. By Read Joint Status, the enabled status, operation status, angle, speed, voltage, current, temperature, force, opening size, error code of the joint can be displayed, and the `Clear Error` operation can be performed.
6. **Firmware Upgrade**:
    Click Upgrade File, find the location of the upgrade file, select the module to upgrade: `Control Board`, `Joint`, click `Start Upgrade`, then the progress bar will show the upgrade progress.
